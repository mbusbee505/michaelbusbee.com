# Building a Home Lab Introduction

Welcome to the Building a Home Lab series! If you're interested in learning more about virtualization, networking, and systems administration, or if youâ€™re looking to boost your IT skills, this hands-on project is a great way to have fun while learning.

Join me as I take my tragically underused gaming desktop and turn it into the start of my home lab. Why a home lab? Home labs are perfect for experimenting with different operating systems, testing network configurations, and getting familiar with various technologies without the risk of breaking anything in a production environment. 

Here's a basic rundown of the project:

1. Install Proxmox
2. Install PFsense
3. Install Tailscale
4. Install Kali Linux
5. Install Windows 11 workstation
6. Install Fedora Linux workstation

I will be setting up Proxmox as a bare-metal install on the computer, then install the VMs and containers I need onto Proxmox. See the diagram below:
