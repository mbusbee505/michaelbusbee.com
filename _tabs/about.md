## About Me

Hey there! I’m Michael Busbee — an IT enthusiast, troubleshooting guru, and passionate lifelong learner on a journey through the evolving landscape that is information technology. I currently work as an IT Support Technician at Shenandoah University, where I lead the IT Help Desk, oversee building support, and troubleshoot a wild variety of devices and network issues. I work with a great team of student technicians, guiding them through the ins and outs of tech support, all while ensuring our campus tech environment runs as smoothly as possible (though, let's be honest, technology always keeps us on our toes).

## My Background

I started my career in customer service, working as a phone-based bank teller for Navy Federal Credit Union. Helping customers troubleshoot issues with their accounts and protecting them against fraud and identity theft laid a solid foundation for my current work in IT/Cybersecurity. My passion for tech led me to Shenandoah, where I’ve been growing and adapting my skillset for the last 2 years.

At the Help Desk, I wear a lot of hats, from managing social media for the Help Desk to overseeing Adobe and Parallels licensing for the university’s mix of Windows and MacOS systems, I get my hands on a bit of everything. I even throw in some knowledge base articles here and there to make sure everyone else has documentation when needed.

## My Certifications and What I’m Learning

I’m CompTIA Security+ certified, and I’m currently working toward my CCNA certification — because a strong foundation in computer networking is crucial. On top of that, I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity. I’m also planning to tackle the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification soon to round out my skillset.

## Tech Interests & Side Projects

I’m a big fan of home labs and building virtual environments, which gives me a playground to explore and tinker with new tech. I’m currently working on a personal project series called “Building a Home Lab,” where I’m turning an old gaming desktop into a tech sandbox with Proxmox, Tailscale, Windows 11, Ubuntu Linux, and a few other tools. So if you’re interested in lab setups or curious about how to repurpose old hardware, stick around. I love making technology accessible and easy to understand—whether I’m helping a user log into their account or writing a guide on networking fundamentals.

## Let’s Connect

I started this blog as a way to share my journey, insights, and misadventures in the world of IT and cybersecurity.
