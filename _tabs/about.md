## About Me

Welcome! I’m Michael Busbee — an IT associate, troubleshooting guru, and passionate lifelong learner on a journey through the evolving landscape that is information technology. I currently work as an IT Support Technician at Shenandoah University where I lead the IT Help Desk, oversee building support, and troubleshoot a wide variety of devices and network issues. I oversee a great team of student technicians, guiding them through the processes and regulations of tech support. We ensure our campus tech environment runs as smoothly as possible (though, let's be honest, technology always keeps us on our toes).

## My Background

I started my career in customer service working as a phone-based bank teller for Navy Federal Credit Union. Helping customers troubleshoot issues with their accounts and protecting them against fraud and identity theft laid a solid foundation for my current work in IT/Cybersecurity. My passion for tech led me to Shenandoah University, where I’ve been growing and adapting my skillset for the past 2 years.

At the Help Desk, I have a range of responsibilities, from managing our social media page for the Help Desk to overseeing Adobe and Parallels licensing for the university’s mix of Windows and MacOS systems. I get my hands on a bit of everything, like knowledge-base articles to provide documentation when needed.

## My Certifications and What I’m Learning

I’m CompTIA Security+ certified, and I’m currently working on my CCNA certification — because a strong foundation in computer networking is crucial. Concurrently, I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity. The next goal is to tackle the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification soon to round out my skillset.

## Tech Interests & Side Projects

I’m a big fan of home labs and building virtual environments, which gives me a playground to explore and tinker with new tech. I’m currently working on a personal project series called “Building a Home Lab,” where I’m turning an old gaming desktop into a tech sandbox with Proxmox, Tailscale, Windows 11, Ubuntu Linux, and a few other tools. So if you’re interested in lab setups or curious about how to repurpose old hardware, stick around. I love making technology accessible and easy to understand—whether I’m helping a user log into their account or writing a guide on networking fundamentals.

## Let’s Connect

I started this blog as a way to share my journey, insights, and misadventures in the world of IT and Cybersecurity. If you’re an IT enthusiast, a fellow Help Desk guardian, or just someone who loves a good tech tip, I’m glad you’re here. Feel free to reach out!
